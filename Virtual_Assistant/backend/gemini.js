import axios from "axios";

export const geminiResponse = async (command, assistantName, userName) => {
  try {
    const apiUrl = process.env.GEMINI_API_URL;

    const prompt = `You are a virtual assistant named ${assistantName} created by ${userName}.
You are not Google. You will now behave like a voice-enabled assistant.

Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond with a JSON object like this:

{
  "type": "general" | "google-search" | "youtube-search" | "youtube-play" |
          "get-time" | "get-date" | "get-day" | "get-month" | "calculator-open" |
          "instagram-open" | "facebook-open" | "weather-show",

  "userInput": "<original user input>" (only remove your name from userinput if exists) and agar
   kisi ne google ya youtube pe kuch search karne ko bola hai to userInput me only vo search baala
    text jaye,

  "response": "<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
}

  instructions:
- "type": determine the intent of the user.
- "userinput": original sentence the user spoke.

 "Today is Tuesday", etc.
